THE PROJECT IDEA

I created this project out of my personal experience as part of a stage-building-collective. 
Usually it was reallly hard to find people to work with that had specific skills and that had time and the will to volunteer 
for a specific project.
Normally search is limited to "your circle" and you miss to get connected with the right people 
because they don't know about your project and you don't know about them.

This Homepage is a mix of showcasing the Work of the collective and a platform to apply and connect the Collective with Volunteers.


GUIDE

THE VISITORS VIEW

HOME ("/")
On the landing page you get an overview about the Collective, what the collective is about and what their work is about. 
From here you can navigate to the PROJECTS and the EVENTS.

EVENTS ("/events")
On the events-page you can see a list of upcoming events. 
You can search these events by name, by the type of event, by date and if its happening outdoor.
If you are interested in knowing more about a specific event click on the details-link to get all you have to know to take part. 

PROJECTS ("/projects")
On the project-page you see a list of upcoming projects, each with a link to a detailed-view. If you follow the link to the detailpage 
you can find all the information given and a slide-show with project-images. If you are interested to volunteer in this specific project 
you can click the link on the bottom of the page that will lead you to the Volunteer-Form.

VOLUNTEER ("/volunteer/{id of specific project}")
The Application-Form can be filled out with personal data and send to apply for a specific project.



THE ADMINS VIEW

BEHIND-THE-SCENCES ("/behind-the-scences")
Here is where the projects and events get born. If you navigate to /behind-the-scences without being logged in,
you will be redirected to "/behind-the-scences/login". If you haven't registered yet you can do so by signing up at "/behind-the-scences/signup".
(For now it is avoided through a "secret" path that people randomly sign up, this will be changed later on to a more secure way.)

ADMIN DASHBOARD
Once you succesfully logged in you are viewing the Admin Dashboard. 
Here are listed all Events and Projects. You can create new Events and Projects, Edit or Delete them.

And here you also find the Applications of Volunteers.
You have two opprtunities:
1. You can see all Applications for a specific Project
2. You can see ALL Applications that have been send

This is very useful, because in the end you have a database with people wanting to work with you and offering there skills and 
can hopefully save a lot of time and nerves finding the right people for the right job!
